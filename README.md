This project showcases minimal my personal website, freisinger.com.ar, where I display various resources and links related to my online presence. The design is inspired by a terminal interface, with a black background, white text, and blue hyperlinks for a retro-computing feel. The content includes links to my blog, Docker events, GitHub profile, resume, Twitter account, and Spotify user page. The font used throughout the website is Roboto, providing a clean and modern appearance. Feel free to explore the links and get in touch with me through any of the provided channels.
